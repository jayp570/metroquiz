        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>I was heavily inspired by <a href="https://iafisher.com/">Ian Fisher's</a> <a href="cityquiz.io">cityquiz.io</a>; a lot of the site design, game functionality, and even the name are modeled after CityQuiz.</p>
        <p>On a more fundamental level, I took inspiration from geography quizzes on <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/">Sporcle</a>, where you can find quizzes for metropolitan areas, as well as other aspects of geography, in a similar vein.</p>
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>Which particular cities to be included in any given metropolitan area was determined by the listed cities on the Wikipedia pages for each area. In the case of the United States, these lists only include incorporated cities/towns. Depending on the state, villages are also included in this classification. </p>
        <p>The city boundaries themselves were acquired from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/30.33270/-95.86650">OpenStreetMap</a> and sometimes drawn in manually in the event of any errors. They were then trimmed to include only land area using land polygon data from <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>.</p>
        <p>The population data is pulled from <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a>. Therefore, this data is accurate as of the year that Wikidata's is accurate - typically no more than 5 years old. Most of the statistics on Wikidata are from government censuses. As a note, the population values for areas on the home page are from the population listed on the area's Wikipedia page. The percentages displayed on quizzes themselves are calculated using the sum of the populations of guessable cities, so people living in unincorporated places are counted on the home page but not the quizzes. This sum, however, is still roughly accurate to the area's population.</p>
        <p>Map graphics are from <a href="https://carto.com/basemaps">CartoDB</a> and are rendered using <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>.</p>
